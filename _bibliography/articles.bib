  title={Do women face a glass ceiling at home? The division of household labor among dual-earner couples},
  author={Lichard, Tomáš and Pertold, Filip and Škoda, Samuel},
  abstract={In this paper, we use data on mixed-gender dual-earner couples in Southern and Western Europe to investigate how the division of unpaid household labor within mixed-gender couples varies depending on the ratio of the partners’ market wages. From analysis of the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, we first show that married or cohabiting women do twice as much household work as single women with the same income. Furthermore, women’s time spent in home production does not vary in relation to the couple’s relative wages in Southern Europe. We find a positive elasticity of substitution between male and female labor in home production with respect to their relative within-couple wages in Western Europe. Our identification is based on predicting each country’s wage distributions within gender-specific cells defined by age group and education using distributions in all the other countries. We present a positive evidence for presence of a “second-shift” that women face especially in Southern Europe, which may stem from regional gender norms.},

  title={Scientific publication performance in post-communist countries: still lagging far behind},
  author={Jurajda, {\v{S}}t{\v{e}}p{\'a}n and Kozubek, Stanislav and M{\"u}nich, Daniel and {\v{S}}koda, Samuel},
  abstract={We present a bibliometric comparison of publication performance in 226 scientific disciplines in the Web of Science (WoS) for six post-communist EU member states relative to six EU-15 countries of a comparable size. We compare not only overall country-level publication counts, but also high quality publication output where publication quality is inferred from the journal Article Influence Scores. As of 2010–2014, post-communist countries are still lagging far behind their EU counterparts, with the exception of a few scientific disciplines mainly in Slovenia. Moreover, research in post-communist countries tends to focus relatively more on quantity rather than quality. The relative publication performance of post-communist countries in the WoS is strongest in natural sciences and engineering. Future research is needed to reveal the underlying causes of these performance differences, which may include funding and productivity gaps, the historical legacy of the communist ideology, and Web of Science coverage differences.},
