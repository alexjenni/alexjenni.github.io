  title={Insuring the self-employed: Evidence on asymmetric information in UI},
  abstract={This project studies selection of self-employed into a voluntary unemployment insurance scheme using administrative data from Slovakia. Contrary to conventional rationale for mandating unemployment insurance I find evidence of advantageous rather than adverse selection into the UI scheme. However, focusing on a reform that reset existing contracts and effectively shrank the pool of insured, I find evidence of adverse selection within the pool of initially insured. These findings are consistent with existence of a non-monotonic marginal cost curve.},
