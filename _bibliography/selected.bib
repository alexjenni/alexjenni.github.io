  title={Collusion by Exclusion in Public Procurement},
  abstract={This paper studies bid rigging in auctions with bidder preselection. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the optimal behavior of a bid-rigging cartel and show how two-stage auction formats, in which the first stage is used to preselect bidders, may be exploited. Bidder preselection based on opening bids allows cartels to exclude rivals and thereby increase procurement costs. To test our predictions, we use administrative data from public procurement in Slovakia. By leveraging a unique auction format reform we show that after a preselection procedure was abandoned, the savings gap between potentially rigged and non-rigged auctions decreased by 48%. In contrast to the conventional motivation for two-stage auctions, our analysis suggests that two-stage auctions might facilitate bid rigging and increase procurement costs.},

  title={Insuring the self-employed: Evidence on asymmetric information in UI},
  abstract={This project studies selection of self-employed into a voluntary unemployment insurance scheme using administrative data from Slovakia. Contrary to conventional rationale for mandating unemployment insurance I find evidence of advantageous rather than adverse selection into the UI scheme. However, focusing on a reform that reset existing contracts and effectively shrank the pool of insured, I find evidence of adverse selection within the pool of initially insured. These findings are consistent with existence of a non-monotonic marginal cost curve.},
