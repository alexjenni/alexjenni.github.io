  title={Directing job search in practice: Mandating pay information in job ads},

  jmp={skoda_jmp.pdf},
  abstract={ Using a policy reform that mandated firms to provide pay information in job ads, I study how  workers adapt their search behavior and firms their hiring decisions, including actual wages. At the time of the reform, only one fifth of job ads contained pay information, strongly  varying across firms and occupations. Linking online job board data to administrative social security data, I find that wages of newly hired workers increased, by about 3%, particularly within complying firms that were induced by the reform to show pay information.  Job ads posted by these firms received more clicks and applications from job-seekers but I do not find evidence that the wage increase was driven by a positive selection of employees:  previous wages of newly hired workers at their prior job did not increase, and additionally, applicants had on average lower pay expectations and characteristics less fitting job ads requirements. Furthermore, I do not find evidence of  closing the gender pay gap. Adapting a simple model of partial job search, I illustrate how to interpret these responses.},

  title={Collusion by exclusion in public procurement},
  abstract={This paper studies bid rigging in auctions with bidder preselection. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the optimal behavior of a bid-rigging cartel and show how two-stage auction formats, in which the first stage is used to preselect bidders, may be exploited. Bidder preselection based on opening bids allows cartels to exclude rivals and thereby increase procurement costs. To test our predictions, we use administrative data from public procurement in Slovakia. By leveraging a unique auction format reform we show that after a preselection procedure was abandoned, the savings gap between potentially rigged and non-rigged auctions decreased by 48%. In contrast to the conventional motivation for two-stage auctions, our analysis suggests that two-stage auctions might facilitate bid rigging and increase procurement costs.},
