  title={Collusion by Exclusion in Public Procurement},
  abstract={This paper studies bid rigging in auctions with bidder preselection. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the optimal behavior of a bid-rigging cartel and show how two-stage auction formats, in which the first stage is used to preselect bidders, may be exploited. Bidder preselection based on opening bids allows cartels to exclude rivals and thereby increase procurement costs. To test our predictions, we use administrative data from public procurement in Slovakia. By leveraging a unique auction format reform we show that after a preselection procedure was abandoned, the savings gap between potentially rigged and non-rigged auctions decreased by 48%. In contrast to the conventional motivation for two-stage auctions, our analysis suggests that two-stage auctions might facilitate bid rigging and increase procurement costs.},

  title={Do Elections Accelerate the COVID-19 Pandemic? Evidence from a Natural Experiment},
  abstract={Elections define representative democracies, but also produce spikes in physical mobility if voters need to travel to electoral rooms. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we test the hypothesis that holding large-scale, in-person elections contributes to faster pandemic spread. We exploit a natural experiment from the Czech Republic which biannually renews mandates in 1/3 of Senate constituencies rotating according to the 1995 election law. We show that in the third week after the second round of 2020 elections (held on October 9-10), new infections grew 25 percentage points faster in voting compared to non-voting constituencies. A simultaneous peak in hospital admissions and little changes in test positivity rates rule out that the acceleration just reflects more frequent testing. The acceleration was pronounced in regions with below-median employment, share of at least secondary-educated population and absent in population older than 65.  Descriptive evidence still indicates increased mobility during elections.},
